every cycle generate coins
use coins to buy an upgrade
upgrade increases the number of coins gained each cycle
upgrade increases in cost

upgrade coin gain is a linear increase
upgrade cost increase is a exponental increase

player chooses which production he wants to buy boosts for
random reward when long idle

- tickets
- startkit

### player colony starter default

greenpod (uses energy)

- oxygen (limited)
- food (use or sell)
- water (use or teraform or sell for huge)

factory (uses energy)

- batteries (limited-expensive-crafting meta)
- energy ( ecess energy -> heat -> terraforming )
- constructions = robots/factories/research

terraforming progress increase 0% on a normal tile with a starter kit

normal tiles:

- planes (+greens 20% more food yield)
- mountains (+techies 20% more resource)

special tiles:

- polar caps (-+)
- with caves (??)
- with volcanos (-+)

- stockpile raw materials and water
- automatically sell eccess food

buy:

- base resource
- seeds (biodiversity)
- robots (specialization, productivity)

tech modes:

- mininig
- research/construction
- terraforming

mine:

- titanium (construction --choose-> production)
- silicon (upgrades --choose-> production)

invest into research or terraforming to speed them up ( both passevly increase but slowly )

1. terraforming generates coins passively

2. research generates blueprints that depend on the economy

sell:

- raw materials
- blueprint
- gene sequences

when a blueprint is sold,
couple of cycles later merch appear in the market,
blueprint seller gets % of sold merch

act:

- craft (meta loop)
